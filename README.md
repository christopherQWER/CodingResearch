This project represents some different ways of compress and coding information.

There are different sources (generators) of input sequensies:
- Geometric (with entropy h = 2.93);
- Markov;
- Arithmetical.

After sequense of input symbols had got, we need to turn it to the code word, which can be transmitted.
There are some methods of coding:
- Golomb coder;
- Huffman coder.
